# Flyway Teamwork Framework

**A collaborative framework for managing database development with Flyway, safely and efficiently, across teams and environments.**

---

## ðŸ”§ What is Flyway Teamwork?

The **Flyway Teamwork Framework** extends core Flyway into a *complete, practical workflow* for team-based database development. It helps database developers, DBAs, and DevOps engineers collaborate effectively on complex databases, with full versioning, auditability, rollback, and branch-based workflows â€” all while preserving the discipline and simplicity that Flyway encourages.

At its core, Flyway Teamwork allows you to:

- Manage **branch-based development** while maintaining strict control over schema changes.
- Cleanly separate *design-time* and *deployment-time* concerns.
- Capture not only database structure, but also **intent, documentation, rationale**, and approval history.
- Support both **imperative** and **declarative** approaches as needed.
- Allow seamless handoff between developers and operations teams.

This framework helps you treat your database not as an afterthought but as a full participant in modern version-controlled, CI/CD-based software delivery pipelines.

## ðŸ’¡ Why was Flyway Teamwork created?

Most database tools focus on generating change scripts â€” but **team-based development adds additional complexity**:

- Multiple developers working simultaneously.
- Feature branches that may diverge and converge.
- Reviewing and approving complex schema changes.
- Retaining institutional knowledge around *why* a change was made.
- Handling documentation changes separately from actual schema changes.
- Ensuring confidence in both *forward* and *backward* deployment paths.

The Flyway Teamwork Framework introduces patterns, conventions, and file structures that enable safe collaborative working â€” while staying compatible with Flywayâ€™s model.

---

## ðŸ“¦ What's included

The framework typically provides:

- **Clear separation of design artifacts** (schema model, documentation, test data, dependencies).
- **Script generation patterns** for both automatic and hand-crafted migration scripts.
- **Metadata layers** to capture narrative, ownership, review status, and deployment intent.
- **Branch management guidance** for feature branches, hotfixes, and release candidates.
- Integration points for:
  - Flyway Desktop
  - Flyway CLI
  - Source control (Git, Azure DevOps, GitHub, etc.)
  - CI/CD pipelines

---

## ðŸ”¬ Who is Flyway Teamwork for?

- Development teams managing evolving databases.
- DBAs overseeing complex schema evolution.
- DevOps teams building automated database delivery pipelines.
- Enterprises seeking auditability, predictability, and traceability in schema management.

Whether you work with SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other RDBMS platforms, the Flyway Teamwork approach applies.
