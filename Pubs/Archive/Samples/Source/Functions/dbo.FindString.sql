CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[FindString]
  /*
summary:  >
 This Table-valued function takes text as a parameter and 
 tries to find it in the WordOccurence table
example:
   - code: SELECT * FROM FindString('disgusting')
   - code: SELECT TOP 10 note_id, Max(NoteStart) AS Note_Start, 
                 Max(InsertionDate)AS Insertion_Date, 
                 Max(InsertedBy) AS Inserted_by  
             from 
	         (SELECT note_id, NoteStart, InsertionDate, InsertedBy 
	         FROM people.note NS
	         INNER JOIN FindString('despite trying all sorts') FW
	         ON FW.note=NS.note_id)f
             group by Note_id
             order by Max(InsertionDate) desc
returns:  >
passes back the location where they were found, and 
the number of words matched in the string.
